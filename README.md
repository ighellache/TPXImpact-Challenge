Coding 'out of the box' to an unconventional assignment
In the attached zip file there are a collection of posters. Please pick one and reproduce it using just HTML and CSS (no images), it does not need to be responsive, but it should look correct in modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge."

## The poster I have chosen:

Although it looks fine on my laptop, I have tested it on MAC and it appears to look slightly shifted. So I created a MAC version which should solve the problem.
The link to the mac version will be found on the site. However, I also used BrowserStack to test how it would appear on MAC and Safari through a digital perspective and they appeared correct.
